# Java Tree
Trying out the native Java with a minimal Christmas tree.

Before that I did the following:

- Download the Microsoft Early access port from here: https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-aarch64/releases/tag/16-ea%2B10-macos
- Move the extracted file to the correct folder: sudo mv jdk-16 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-16

As of then, a java -version worked. For the other binaries, I had to go to the directory and open them once with Terminal to get MacOS to accept them.
